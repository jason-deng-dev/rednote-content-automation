**Project:** automation-ecosystem — Scraper

**Platform:** running.moximoxi.net — Japanese marathon platform for Chinese runners

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/jason-deng-dev/automation-ecosystem](https://github.com/jason-deng-dev/automation-ecosystem) (`services/scraper/`)

**Author:** Jason Deng

**Date:** March 2026

**Status:** In Development — `scraper.js` ported to `services/scraper/`; Dockerfile and package.json not yet created

---

## 1. What This Is

The Scraper is a pure cron process running as a Docker container. It scrapes RunJapan weekly and writes `races.json` to a shared Docker volume. No HTTP server. No persistent process. Just a file writer on a schedule.

The Race Hub container reads `races.json` from that same volume and serves it to WordPress. They are fully decoupled — the scraper just writes a file, the Race Hub just reads it.

For Race Hub design (Express API + React SPA), see `services/race-hub/docs/race-hub-design-doc.md`.

## 3. What It Scrapes

RunJapan (runjapan.jp) — the most complete Japanese marathon listing source.

**Fields extracted per race:**

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `name` | Race name |
| `name_zh` | Chinese translation of name (DeepL EN→ZH-HANS) |
| `url` | RunJapan detail page URL |
| `date` | Race date |
| `date_zh` | Chinese translation of date string (DeepL EN→ZH-HANS) |
| `location` | Prefecture / city |
| `location_zh` | Chinese translation of location (DeepL EN→ZH-HANS) |
| `entryStart` | Entry window open date |
| `entryStart_zh` | Chinese translation of entryStart (DeepL EN→ZH-HANS) |
| `entryEnd` | Entry window close date |
| `entryEnd_zh` | Chinese translation of entryEnd (DeepL EN→ZH-HANS) |
| `registrationOpen` | Boolean — derived from entry window |
| `registrationUrl` | Direct signup link |
| `website` | Race official site |
| `description` | Race description text |
| `description_zh` | Chinese translation of description (DeepL EN→ZH-HANS) |
| `info` | Additional race info (structured key-value — keys are section labels, values are text or nested objects) |
| `info_zh` | Chinese translation of all keys and values in `info`, preserving nested structure (DeepL EN→ZH-HANS) |
| `notice` | Notices / warnings (English) |
| `notice_zh` | Chinese translations of notice items (DeepL EN→ZH-HANS) |
| `images` | Array of image URLs |

## 4. Scraping Approach

**Two-pass scrape:**

1. **Pass 1 — listing page:** POST `runjapan.jp` search endpoint with `availableFlag=0` (include all races, not just open-entry ones). Extract all race card links. Each card contains a `raceId` param (e.g. `raceId=E335908`).
2. **Pass 2 — detail pages:** For each race link, GET the detail page and extract structured data.

**Session handling:** The listing page is paginated. Page 2+ requires a cookie set by the initial POST response. Uses `tough-cookie` + `axios-cookiejar-support` to maintain the session automatically across requests.

**Output:** Writes `scraper/races.json` only if ≥ 30 races are returned — preserves last good output if run fails or returns partial data.

---

## 5. Output Files

Both files written to the shared Docker volume:

**`scraper/races.json`**
- Array of race objects (see §3 for schema)
- Includes `last_updated` ISO timestamp at top level
- Contains both English and Chinese fields per race — all translatable fields have a corresponding `_zh` variant (`name_zh`, `date_zh`, `location_zh`, `entryStart_zh`, `entryEnd_zh`, `description_zh`, `info_zh`, `notice_zh`)
- Read by Race Hub container and XHS container

**`scraper/pipeline_state.json`**

Written at run start and end so the Dashboard can poll current scraper state.

```json
{ "state": "idle | running | failed" }
```

Written as `"running"` before the scrape starts, then updated to `"idle"` or `"failed"` when the run completes. Read by Dashboard via `GET /api/pipeline-state`.

---

**`scraper/run_log.json`**

Object keyed by ISO timestamp. Each entry represents one scraper run.

```json
{
  "2026-03-25T02:00:00.000Z": {
    "outcome": "success | failed",
    "races_scraped": 87,
    "failure_count": 2,
    "failed_urls": ["https://runjapan.jp/race/E123456"],
    "error_msg": null
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `outcome` | string | `"success"` or `"failed"` |
| `races_scraped` | number | Number of races successfully written to races.json |
| `failure_count` | number | Number of detail pages that failed to scrape |
| `failed_urls` | string[] | URLs of races that failed — empty array on clean run |
| `error_msg` | string \| null | Top-level error message if run aborted, `null` otherwise |

Read by Dashboard to show scraper health and last run time.

## 6. Technical Decisions

|Decision|Choice|Alternatives Considered|Rationale|
|---|---|---|---|
|Scrape target|RunJapan only|JogNote, marathon-link.com|RunJapan has the most complete race data; single source reduces complexity|
|Scrape cadence|Weekly|Daily, real-time|Race data changes slowly; weekly is fresh enough; reduces RunJapan request load|
|HTTP requests|axios|node-fetch, native fetch|More reliable for scraping; better error handling and timeout support|
|HTML parsing|cheerio|jsdom, regex|Lightweight jQuery-style API; purpose-built for server-side HTML parsing|
|Session handling|tough-cookie + axios-cookiejar-support|Manual cookie extraction|Jar captures cookies automatically — replicates browser session behaviour with no manual work|
|Error handling|Log and continue per race|Abort on first failure|One bad detail page should not abort the full run — partial data is better than no data|
|Retries|axios-retry: 3 retries, exponential backoff, network errors + 5xx only|Manual retry loop|axios has no built-in retry; axios-retry is a one-liner; only retries transient failures|
|Output protection|Only overwrite races.json on successful run (≥ 30 races)|Always overwrite|Preserves last good data if scraper crashes or RunJapan returns partial results|
|Language|Node.js / JavaScript|Python|Consistent with rest of stack|

## 7. Implementation

### 7.1 Current Status

|Component|Status|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Core scraping logic|✅ Done|`scraper.js` ported to `services/scraper/`|
|Scraper container (standalone)|🔧 In progress|scraper.js ported; Dockerfile + package.json + cron wiring still needed|
|races.json|🔧 Partial|Will be written to shared_volume/scraper/ — stale copy in xhs/data/ kept only for local XHS testing|
|run_log.json|❌ Not started|New — add structured logging to scraper|
|Deploy|❌ Not started|—|

### 7.2 Phase 1 — Standalone Scraper Container

1. ~~Port `scraper.js` from `services/xhs/src/scraper.js`~~ ✅ Done
2. Add structured `run_log.json` output (timestamp, races scraped, failure count, failed URLs, outcome)
3. Validate output — abort + preserve previous `races.json` if < 30 races returned
4. Wire weekly cron (Sunday 2am JST)
5. Dockerfile + docker-compose integration

**Exit criteria:** `races.json` contains 30+ races with complete data. Cron runs cleanly weekly. `run_log.json` written on each run.

### 7.3 Phase 2 — Incremental Scraping

1. On startup, load existing `races.json` and build `Map<url, race>` for O(1) lookup
2. Scrape RunJapan listing pages to get current set of race URLs
3. For each URL: if already in map, reuse existing race object — skip detail page re-scrape
4. For new URLs: scrape detail page, add to output set
5. Drop races no longer appearing in RunJapan listing
6. Merge and proceed to translation pass

See §8.4 for the problem statement and full rationale.

---

### 7.4 Phase 3 — Chinese Translation


After the full scrape is complete, run a translation pass using DeepL API (EN → ZH-HANS).

**Timing:** Translate after `races.json` is fully populated — not per-race during scraping. Races may be deduplicated or dropped during the scrape pass; translating only the final set avoids wasting DeepL quota on discarded records.

**Fields translated per race:**

| Source field | Translated field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `name_zh` | Full race name |
| `date` | `date_zh` | Date string as scraped |
| `location` | `location_zh` | Prefecture / city string |
| `entryStart` | `entryStart_zh` | Entry open date string |
| `entryEnd` | `entryEnd_zh` | Entry close date string |
| `description` | `description_zh` | Full description text |
| `info` (all keys + values) | `info_zh` | Translate keys and values recursively — preserve nested structure |
| `notice[]` | `notice_zh[]` | Translate each item individually |

**Incremental translation:**
- Only translate races where any `_zh` field is missing or the corresponding source field has changed since the last run
- Compare by hashing source fields — avoid re-translating unchanged content to conserve DeepL quota

**Failure handling:**
- If DeepL is unavailable or quota exceeded: write `races.json` with all `_zh` fields set to `null` for affected races — UI falls back to English fields gracefully

**Technical decisions:**
- DeepL API key stored in scraper `.env`
- Translation runs as a post-scrape pass in the same process, before `races.json` is written

## 8. Engineering Challenges & Solutions

### 8.1 RunJapan Has No Public API

**Challenge:** All race data must be scraped from HTML. RunJapan's markup may change without notice.

**Solution:** Selectors isolated in config; validation aborts without overwriting `races.json` if < 30 races returned. Core scraping logic proven in production.

### 8.2 Scraper Pagination: Session-Dependent Navigation

**Challenge:** RunJapan's search results are paginated, but page 2+ URLs (e.g. `?command=page&pageIndex=2`) only return results when the server can resolve an active search session. The session is established by the initial `?command=search` request and tied to a cookie. When axios hits page 2 directly without that cookie, the server has no session context and returns an empty result set — silently, with no error.

**Symptoms:** Scraper consistently returns only 10 races (one page) regardless of the `limit` parameter. Page 2 URL is structurally correct but returns 0 cards.

**Solution:** Add a cookie jar to the axios instance using `tough-cookie` and `axios-cookiejar-support`. The jar automatically captures cookies set by the page 1 response and sends them with every subsequent request — exactly replicating the browser's session behaviour. No manual cookie extraction or header manipulation required.

### 8.3 Scraper Returns Only Enterable Races by Default

**Challenge:** RunJapan's search form submits a POST request (not GET) with a form body including `availableFlag: 1`, which filters results to currently-open-entry races only. The scraper was using a GET request to `?command=search`, which caused the server to apply this default filter — returning only ~22 enterable races and missing major races (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto) whose entry windows had already closed.

**Symptoms:** Scraper returns 22 races in a fresh session; browser logged-in session appeared to show 60 because the user had previously searched with the filter unchecked. Incognito browser confirmed the same 22 result count.

**Discovery:** Network tab inspection of a manual form submission (with "Enterable tournaments only" unchecked) revealed the actual POST payload. Key fields: `command=search`, `distanceClass=0`, `availableFlag=1` (the enterable-only flag).

**Solution:** Change the initial page 1 request from GET to POST with a form-encoded body matching the manual search, setting `availableFlag=0` to include all races regardless of entry status. Subsequent pagination requests (`?command=page&pageIndex=N`) remain GET requests using the session cookie established by the initial POST.

### 8.4 Full Re-Scrape Every Run Wastes DeepL Quota

**Challenge:** The scraper originally rebuilt `races[]` from scratch on every weekly run. With translation added, this would re-translate all ~60 races every run even when nothing changed — burning DeepL quota on identical content and adding unnecessary latency.

**Solution:** Incremental scraping. On startup, load existing `races.json` and build a `Map<url, race>` in memory. During the listing scrape, check each race URL against the map — if already present, reuse the existing object (including all `_zh` fields) and skip re-scraping the detail page. Only new URLs trigger a detail-page fetch. Translation pass then only runs on races missing `_zh` fields.

**Why URL as key, not name:** Each RunJapan URL contains a unique `raceId` (e.g. `raceId=E335908`). Names can repeat across years. URL is guaranteed unique for the lifetime of a listing.

**Why keep races.json as an array:** Race Hub and the SPA both consume races as an array. The `Map` is in-memory only — `races.json` stays as `[]` with no changes needed to any consumer.

### 8.5 Concurrent DeepL Requests Trigger Rate Limiting

**Challenge:** The initial translation implementation used `Promise.all` to translate all races concurrently. Each race made one DeepL API call per field (name, date, location, entryStart, entryEnd, description, each info key, each info value, each notice item) — resulting in hundreds of simultaneous requests. DeepL rejected these with a "Too many requests" error.

**Solution:** Two changes. First, batch all translatable strings for a race into a single array and make one `translateText` call per race (DeepL accepts an array of strings and returns results in order). Second, process races sequentially with a `for` loop instead of `Promise.all` — one batched call at a time, no concurrent requests.

**Tradeoff:** Sequential processing is slower than concurrent, but translation only runs on new races (existing races reuse cached `_zh` fields from incremental scraping). In practice, most weekly runs translate zero races.

---

## 9. Testing Strategy

The scraper is tested against live output — we can't guarantee which races appear, so tests validate shape and completeness, not exact content.

**`scraper.test.js`:**

- All required fields present on every race object (`name`, `date`, `location`, `entryStart`, `entryEnd`, `registrationOpen`, `registrationUrl`, `website`, `description`)
- No `null` or `undefined` values on required fields
- Minimum race count threshold (≥ 30)
- Date fields match expected format

---

## 10. Failure Handling

**Per-race failure:** The inner loop wraps each `getInfo()` call in try/catch. If a single race detail page times out, 404s, or has malformed HTML, the error is logged and the scraper continues to the next race.

**Retry behaviour:** `axios-retry` wraps the axios instance with 3 retries and exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s). Only retries transient failures (network errors, 5xx). 404s and 400s are not retried.

**Full scrape failure:** `races.json` is only overwritten on a successful run (≥ 30 races returned). If the scraper crashes or returns fewer than the threshold, the previous `races.json` is preserved.

**Manual recovery:** Re-run the scraper container manually, or trigger via `POST /api/sync` on the Race Hub.
